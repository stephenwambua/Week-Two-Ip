                   <h1>AKAN NAME</h1>
                   <p> welcome to our webpage. This web application takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name will be displayed.
                   <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Feel free to try out and see what happens</p>
